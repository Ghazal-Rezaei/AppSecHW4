1. Implicit and Explicit Intents.
2. Explicit Intents
3. It's an implicit intent, because it does not specify which Android components should be called.
4. It's an explicit intent, because it references the Java activity class.
5. The explicit intent in question 4 is the proper way to do an intent.

Fix:
I changed the file "SecondFragment.kt" and replaced the implicit intent with an explicit version, using the code var intent = Intent(activity, ProductScrollingActivity::class.java), just like the explicit intent in the file "ThirdFragment.kt".
